# 🥡 A/B Testing of Fast Food Promotion Effectiveness

## 📋 Project Overview

In the competitive fast food market, promotions are crucial for attracting customers and boosting sales. This project evaluates the effectiveness of different promotions through an A/B test analysis using sales data from a fast food chain. The primary goal is to identify which of the three promotions (Promotion 1, Promotion 2, and Promotion 3) is the most effective in increasing sales.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

1. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution of sales and the relationship between store characteristics and promotions.
2. **📊 ANOVA and Tukey Test**: Identify significant differences in sales between promotions and compare them.
3. **🔄 Resampling (Bootstrap)**: Assess the variability of the estimates using bootstrap techniques.
4. **📈 Visualization and Conclusions**: Visualize the results and provide actionable recommendations.

### 💡 Importance

By identifying the most effective promotion, the fast food chain can optimize its marketing strategies and maximize revenue. The use of robust statistical techniques and simulations ensures reliable conclusions and recommendations.
